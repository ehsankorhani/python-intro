# Custom Functions

Just as the values, a piece of logic can also be associated with name.

```py
def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b
```

The ```def``` keyword tells Python compiler that we have a reusable code.

To use the function:

```py
result = multiply(2, 3)

print(result)
>>> 9
```

## Parameters

Functions can accept none, one, or many arguments.
