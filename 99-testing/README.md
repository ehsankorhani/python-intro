# Testing

Testing code helps identify bugs and errors, especially when working in teams or in larger applications.<br>
In addition, it promotes writing better code and guides developers to refactor to a clean code.

### Unit tests vs. Integration tests

A unit test is a test that happens in isolation. In other words, it should only test one small unit of code when we mock or fake it's interactions with other part of code.

On the other hand, the integration testing is done to test how different component of the application work with each other (e.g. data access code and database).

## Testing frameworks

There are quite a few test runners available for Python. ```unittest``` is a built-in standard library.
